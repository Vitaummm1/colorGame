<h2>About</h2>
<p>I had the idea to make this game after carrying out an activity proposed in the course <b>"The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022 - by Colt Steele"</b>, which consisted of creating a Score Keeper for table tennis matches.</p>
<p>While doing the activity, I had a new idea of ​​something I would like to try programming, when I remembered a filter I saw on Instagram.</p>
<p>This is how this project came about.</p>

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<p>The technologies used to execute the project are the ones I have had contact with in the course so far, which are: <b>HTML, CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b></p>
<p>I even considered using Bootstrap as a framework, but I decided to do all the CSS customizations myself.</p>
<p>This is how this project came about.</p>

<h2>Demo</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="colorGuessing.gif" alt="A demonstration of game running"></p>
<p>I started by doing the basic programming of the code: I added the elements in the HTML, programmed the game start function and the game end function.</p>
<p>Then I added the HTML element and coding for the scoring, followed by customizing the style, in the CSS file.</p>
<p>Finally, I added criteria to decrease the range of different colors as the score increased.</p>
